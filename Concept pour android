Objective : Réaliser une application Android (≥ 2 activités) en Java qui communique 
            avec le site web et visualise au minimum les failles.

So your Android app must:
	1.	Be coded in Java (not Kotlin).
	2.	Contain at least 2 activities (screens).
	3.	Communicate with your website (backend) using JSON data.
	4.	Display at least the list of detected vulnerabilities that are stored in the database.

Activity 1 — Main / Login / Menu Screen
Purpose:
	•	This is the entry point of the app.
	•	It could be a menu or a login screen, depending on your design.

Examples of what this activity could do:
	•	Simple “Welcome” page with a button: “View Detected Vulnerabilities”.
	•	Or, if you want to be more advanced, a login screen (username + password) to authenticate with the website.

Activity 2 — Vulnerability List Screen
Purpose:
	•	Fetch and display the list of vulnerabilities from the website.

Main features:
	•	When opened, it sends an HTTP GET request to your website’s API endpoint (like https://yourserver/api/vulnerabilities).
	•	Receives a JSON response.
	•	Parses the JSON into Java objects.
	•	Displays them in a RecyclerView (scrollable list).

Activity 3 (Details Screen)
•	When the user taps on one vulnerability in the list, it opens a new screen that shows detailed info.
	•	It can show:
	•	IP address
	•	Description
	•	Severity
	•	Suggested fix
•	You pass the data via an Intent.
